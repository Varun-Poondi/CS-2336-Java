    //function that breeds the ant
        //no traversal is needed for ant or beetle
        //if the north position of the ant is null
            //northOpenSpace = true;
        //...Do this for all direction
        //pass this info into the breed method you create in the ANT class,
        //do a case statmenet on how to move, movement is same as in ant move
    //function that breeds the beetle
        //litterly the same concept as the breed for ant
        //The only difference is that you are gonna have to breed only after 8 turns has passed
        
        
//Thats it....You create the brains in the ant and beetle classes and you should be good. Im busy with other stuff so I don't have time to write the pseudo code for ANT and BEETLE classes, but this should give you a good boost. You don't need to write it like this and you can def use what you had previously written and integrate it into the code. Hope this helps.
